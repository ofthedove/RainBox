## Rain Box Desktop Sketch
This is the first sketch I made. It can play pink noise, white noise with a filter to "brown"-ify it a bit, and rain nosie off the SD card. To switch between noise types just turn the volume down to zero and back up. I was pretty proud of that single-knob UI but the feature wasn't really useful, since we always played rain noise. In fact, it was annoying, since I made rain nosie the third option and it doesn't remember which option was last selected on boot, so every time I turned it on I had to cycle through. That was too complicated to explain to anyone else.

## Teensy Noise Maker
This is the second sketch I made on the Surface. I had to make it from scratch because my first sketch was only on my desktop, so I didn't have access to it while travelling. It's a much simpler sketch, it only has the SD card player and volume control.
